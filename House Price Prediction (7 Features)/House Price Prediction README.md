# House Price Prediction

## Overview
This project focused on predicting house prices using a dataset with features related to area demographics and house characteristics. The implementation was vectorized without using any for loops, utilizing both the normal equation method and gradient descent for optimization.

## Dataset Details
The dataset contained the following columns:
- **Avg. Area Income**: Average income of residents in the area.
- **House Age**: Age of the house.
- **Number of Rooms**: Number of rooms in the house.
- **Number of Bedrooms**: Number of bedrooms in the house.
- **Area Population**: Population of the city where the house is located.
- **Price**: Price at which the house is sold.

## Implementation
- Used Google Colab for development.
- Implemented the solution using fully vectorized operations.
- Avoided any for loops to ensure efficiency and speed.
